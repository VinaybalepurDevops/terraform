Workspaces
1. This is used to have different env for each of the instance such as Dev, QA, Prod env
2. To achieve this, we need to use virtual env(Workspace) and completely parametrized tf files.
3. Following are the commands avaialble for worskpace creation
        delete    Delete a workspace
        list      List Workspaces
        new       Create a new workspace
        select    Select a workspace
        show      Show the name of the current workspace
4. Creation of new work space - terraform workspace new dev
5. terraform workspace list - Will show 2 workspaces, default and dev
6. terraform workspace select dev - Switch to dev work space
7. If we change the workspace from default to dev or anything to anything it will recreate the infra again in the new workspace
8. This will create tfstate file for each of the workspace seperately

                *************************************   
Creation of vpc with workspaces
Have a file called vpc.tf with following entries. This will be parametrized compeletly

#Creation of VPC
module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"

  name = var.name
  cidr = var.cidr

  azs             = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
  private_subnets = [var.private-subnet1, var.private-subnet2]
  public_subnets  = [var.public-subnet1, var.public-subnet2]

  enable_nat_gateway = true
  enable_vpn_gateway = false

  tags = {
    Terraform = "true"
    Environment = var.env
  }
}

Have variable.tf file to update the parameters of the vpc.tf file

variable "env"{
        
}

variable "name"{
        
}

variable "cidr"{

}

variable "private-subnet1"{

}

variable "private-subnet2"{

}

variable "public-subnet1"{

}

variable "public-subnet2"{
        
}


Have different tfvars. Such as dev.tfvars, stage.tfvars

dev.tfvars will have following entries

env="dev"
name="dev-vpc"
cidr="10.0.0.0/16"
private-subnet1="10.0.1.0/24"
private-subnet2="10.0.2.0/24"
public-subnet1="10.0.101.0/24"
public-subnet2="10.0.102.0/24"

stage.tfvars will have following entries

env="stage"
name="stage-vpc"
cidr="192.168.0.0/16"
private-subnet1="192.168.2.0/24"
private-subnet2="192.168.3.0/24"
public-subnet1="192.168.4.0/24"
public-subnet2="192.168.5.0/24"

Run the following commands for either stage or dev

terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"

terraform workspace select stage
terraform apply -var-file="stage.tfvars"

This approach will create 2 tfstate files in 2 different subfolders
terraform.tfstate.d/dev/terraform.tfstate
terraform.tfstate.d/stage/terraform.tfstate

To destory use the following commands
terraform workspace select dev
terraform destroy -var-file="dev.tfvars"

terraform workspace select stage
terraform destroy -var-file="stage.tfvars"
